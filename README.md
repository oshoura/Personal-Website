# Omar Shoura's Personal Website

Welcome to the repository of my [website](https://omarshoura.com). It is available at https://omarshoura.com. I made this website to highlight my personality, achievements, experience, and skills. 

This website was built using a [template](https://dribbble.com/shots/5456980-Modern-Resume-CV) I found online created by DevCrud. However, I made many changes to the template, and the website only possesses a few elements from the template. I opened a [PR](https://github.com/oshoura/Personal-Website/pull/1) to show the changes I made to the template. Here is a list of what I changed:
- Built dynamic resume timeline, with custom css
- Created skills tag
- Wrote custom JS
- Removed elements and components
- Modified existing components as I saw fit
- Updated colors, fonts and themes
- Modified CSS and HTML as necessary

## Outcome

The main reason I built my website in html and css instead of a no code tool is to gain more exposure and build comfort with web development tools. I believe in the importance of being a well rounded engineer with knowledge across multiple disciplines. I improved my skills in:
- html
- css
- bootstrap
- Github pages
- domain hosting

I will continue to do more web development projects if the opportunity arises.

## What can be improved

For this project, main thing that can be improved is cleaning up. Since I started with a template, the repo had a lot of unfamiliar code. So, even as I deleted certain parts of the code, artifacts of it remained. There is a single css file that's quite long and has a lot of unnecessary elements that can be removed. However, since I was able to build my website to my liking as is, I didn't prioritize this clean up
