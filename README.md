# Omar Shoura's Personal Website

Welcome to the repository of my [website](https://omarshoura.com). It is available at https://omarshoura.com. I made this website to highlight my personality, achievements, experience, and skills. 

This website was built using a [template](https://dribbble.com/shots/5456980-Modern-Resume-CV) I found online created by DevCrud. However, I made many changes to the template, and the website only possesses a few elements from the template. Here is a list of what I changed:
- Removed elements and components
- Modified existing components as I saw fit
- Updated colors, fonts and themes
